# Cloudinary Setup Guide

## 1. Create a Cloudinary Account
1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)

From your Cloudinary dashboard, copy these values:

## 3. Create an Upload Preset
1. In your Cloudinary dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **Upload**
2. Scroll down to **Upload presets**
3. Click **Add upload preset**
4. Configure the preset:
   - **Preset name**: `graphics2prints_products` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Signing Mode**: Select **Unsigned** (for frontend uploads)
   - **Folder**: `graphics2prints/products` (optional, helps organize uploads)
   - **Format**: Auto

## 4. Update Your Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

## 6. Security Best Practices

### Upload Preset Security
For production, consider:
1. Setting up **signed uploads** for better security
2. Adding **upload restrictions** (file size, format, etc.)
3. Implementing **transformation restrictions**

### Folder Organization
The current setup uploads to: `graphics2prints/products/`
You can customize this in the widget configuration.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Widget not loading**: Check that your cloud name is correct
2. **Upload failing**: Verify your upload preset is set to "unsigned"
3. **Images not displaying**: Ensure the URLs are accessible and valid

### Testing:
1. Try uploading a test image through the admin interface
2. Check that the image appears in your Cloudinary media library
3. Verify the URL is saved correctly in your database
